<img src="http://www.serenityhospicecares.com/images/stories/aboutimg.jpg" border="0" hspace="13" align="right" />Serenity Hospice Care was founded by Nurses and Physicians in 2006 who had a passion and commitment in caring for people.  We started providing care in 2006 and are now currently serving patients’ and their families in 67 counties in Georgia.  We currently have clinical offices located throughout  Georgia.  Today, we employ highly skilled nurses, chaplains, physicians, social workers and volunteers. The compassion and quality of care offered at Serenity Hospice is the result of those who do the caring.  <br />
